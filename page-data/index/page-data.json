To include styling, you must include the apts-storybook-lite package.\r\n\r\n```node\r\nnpm i @costar/apts-storybook-lite\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis dependency is managed by the front end team in the solution. But it is required then to import the styles into your solutions.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"@costar/apts-storybook-lite/dist/style.min.css\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Apartments\r\n\r\nThe apartments solution uses a bundle system to include js dependencies. For this, the web components include a bundle.js in the dist. Apartments has a gulp command to copy the include bundle file over the package. Once the package is bumped, run the following command in the command prompt to update. Once the bundle is included, there is no other setup. You can use components throughout the solution where needed.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ngulp copy-components\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Angular Solution\r\n\r\nDocumentation coming.\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\nIf you have solution that is not either of these, please see the stencil documentation for [framework integrations](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) about how to use the web components.\r\n\r\n## Git\r\n\r\nThe git is located at the following location.
